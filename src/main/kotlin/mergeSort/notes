Merge sort is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms. With a time complexity of
O(n log n), it’s one of the fastest of all general-purpose sorting algorithms. The idea
behind merge sort is divide and conquer — to break a big problem into several
smaller, easier-to-solve problems, and then combine those solutions into a final
result. The merge sort mantra is to split first and merge after.
